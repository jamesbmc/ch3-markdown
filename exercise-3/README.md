# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# pwd
The `pwd` command can be used to **print** the current working directory. For example, in the ~/Desktop directory:
```
pwd
```
results in the output
```
/c/users/your_name/Desktop
```
Some more information:
- It can print the win32 format with the -W command as so `pwd -W`
- The exit status returns 0 unless an invalid location is given or the current directory cannot be read

_How fun!_
